   - The provided QR codes can be printed and scanned during the event for streamlined session attendance tracking.

4. **Event Proper:**
   - Scan participants' QR codes for each session they attend to efficiently track their event engagement.
   - Real-time attendance tracking ensures accurate insights into participant interactions.

5. **Post-event Custom Survey:**
   - Following the event, the system automatically sends a custom post-event survey to participants based on the sessions they attended.
   - Gather valuable feedback on each session to further refine future events.

6. **Product Recommendations:**
   - Based on the initial interest survey, sessions attended, and post-event survey feedback, the system intelligently generates personalized product recommendations.
   - Participants receive tailored product suggestions via email, enhancing their post-event engagement and fostering continued interest.
